# Image-Classification
## CNN model
## Binary Cross Entropy
### to predict the class of the test photos (cats or dogs).

##### PS- Github won't let me upload so many photos, so I didn't. You can use this model with any data you want. Just make sure that the images are in 'jpg', 'jpeg' or 'png' formats.
##### Also, make a folder named 'model' in the same directory as this notebook. The last line of code saves the model in a h5 file.
